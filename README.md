Perfect ✅ Here’s a polished **README.md** for your **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction** project:


# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

A **machine learning project** that predicts bike-sharing demand based on environmental and seasonal features.  
The project uses **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models, deployed via an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** that allows real-time predictions and visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predict bike demand using ML models (Decision Tree & Random Forest)  
- Interactive **Streamlit UI** for user inputs and predictions  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with histograms, scatter plots, and time-series trends  
- R² score evaluation to measure model accuracy  
- Dataset visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Framework**: Streamlit  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `hour.csv`, which contains:  
- **instant, dteday, season, yr, mnth, hr, holiday, weekday, workingday, weathersit, temp, atemp, hum, windspeed, casual, registered, cnt**  

Target variable: **cnt (total bike rentals)**
